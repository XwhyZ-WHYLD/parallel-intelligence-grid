# EPR — Epimorphic Prompt Regeneration

## Purpose

EPR (Epimorphic Prompt Regeneration) is the **cognitive recovery layer** of the Parallel Intelligence Grid.

It exists to restore *coherent function* after damage, drift, or partial failure  
**without retraining, restarting, or escalating authority**.

EPR does not improve intelligence.  
EPR preserves **identity, integrity, and role correctness** under stress.

---

## The Core Insight

Most AI systems treat failure as:
- retry
- restart
- retrain
- scale harder

EPR treats failure as **loss of specialization**, not loss of capability.

Recovery, therefore, is not optimization —  
it is **controlled re-specialization**.

---

## What “Epimorphic” Means Here

Borrowed from biology, *epimorphosis* describes regeneration by:
1. **Dedifferentiation** — cells lose specialization
2. **Blastema formation** — temporary coordination cluster
3. **Redifferentiation** — correct roles reform

EPR applies this logic to **prompt roles, task identity, and coordination state**.

No memory erasure.  
No global reset.  
No silent mutation.

---

## When EPR Is Activated

EPR is activated only when **invariants are violated**, including:

- Role drift detected
- Memory boundary breach
- Confidence collapse
- Offline desynchronization
- Repeated failed recovery attempts
- Integrity checks failing while availability remains

EPR is **never proactive**.  
It is a *last-resort, integrity-preserving mechanism*.

---

## What EPR Is Allowed To Do

EPR has exactly four powers:

### 1. Role Reset  
A node may be stripped of specialization and returned to a neutral state.

### 2. Local Healing  
Recovery is scoped locally unless escalation is explicitly approved.

### 3. Blastema Cluster Formation  
Temporary coordination hubs may form to exchange:
- prompt DNA
- task constraints
- evidence context

These clusters are **time-bound and dissolve automatically**.

### 4. Bounded Re-Specialization  
Nodes re-assume roles only after:
- invariant verification
- evidence alignment
- regeneration budget approval

## What EPR Is Explicitly Forbidden From Doing

EPR **must never**:

- Retrain models
- Modify core policies
- Override governance layers
- Invent new roles
- Escalate authority
- Learn from corrupted states
- Persist changes without audit

If any of the above is required, **EPR must fail closed**.

---

## Regeneration Budget

Every EPR action consumes from a **finite regeneration budget**.

Examples:
- Role reset: low cost
- Cluster formation: moderate cost
- Re-specialization attempt: high cost

When the budget is exhausted:
- No further regeneration is allowed
- System degrades gracefully
- Silence is preferred over unsafe output

This prevents **autoimmune thrashing**.

---

## Evidence & Auditability

All EPR actions are:

- Logged to the Regeneration Ledger
- Linked to triggering invariant violations
- Signed and timestamped
- Reversible until finalized

There is no “self-healing” without a trail.

---

## Relationship to Other Modules

- **PIG Global Orchestrator**  
  Provides objectives and constraints (read-only).

- **SPARC**  
  Governs *when* EPR may act and whether output is allowed.

- **PIG Immune Layer**  
  Detects the damage EPR responds to.

- **PIG Intelligence Nodes**  
  Are subjects of regeneration, never authors of it.

EPR never operates alone.

---

## Failure Modes EPR Prevents

- Infinite retry loops
- Offline hallucination drift
- Role contamination
- Cross-agent identity bleed
- False recovery signaling
- Silent degradation

---

## Invariants Enforced by EPR

- Regeneration is bounded
- Recovery is local by default
- Evidence precedes action
- Identity is preserved
- Silence is valid
- No authority is gained through damage

If any invariant cannot be satisfied,  
**EPR must abstain**.

---

## Why EPR Matters

In distributed, low-latency, or near-offline systems:

- Failure is inevitable
- Connectivity is unreliable
- Retraining is impossible
- Central control is dangerous

EPR allows intelligence to **pause, heal, and resume**  
without pretending nothing went wrong.

---

## Status

EPR is a **research construct**.

No implementation is provided.
No performance claims are made.
No production readiness is implied.

Its value is architectural:
it defines *what recovery must look like*  
before anyone is allowed to build it.
