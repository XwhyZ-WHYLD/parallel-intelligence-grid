# PIG Reactor Mesh v1.0

Module Class: Foundational Runtime Layer  
Status: Technical Integration Draft  
Scope: Constraint-Governed Distributed Intelligence Runtime

---

## 1. Purpose

PIG Reactor Mesh v1.0 operationalizes the Parallel Intelligence Grid into a unified runtime system capable of:

- Partition-tolerant cognition
- Constraint-enforced execution
- Regenerative recovery
- Behavioral integrity preservation
- Evidence-bound output control
- Power-adaptive scaling

It converts PIG from architectural doctrine into an executable constraint control plane.

---

## 2. Architectural Position

The Reactor Mesh sits between:

Above:
- Application agents
- Domain intelligence services

Below:
- Compute substrate
- Storage substrate
- Network substrate
- Power Abstraction Layer (PAL)

It functions as the runtime governance layer for distributed intelligence.

## 3. Integrated Constraint Stack

### 3.1 SPARC — Execution Governance

Prevents unbounded action propagation.

Enforces:
- Permission gating
- Policy constraints
- Execution trace integrity

---

### 3.2 ARC / SQI — Evidence-Bound Inference

Prevents hallucination cascade.

Enforces:
- Confidence gating
- Signal proportionality
- Output attenuation under weak evidence

---

### 3.3 IMMU — Behavioral Immune Monitoring

Detects:
- Steering attempts
- Drift patterns
- Long-horizon manipulation

Prevents subtle corruption across mesh nodes.

---

### 3.4 IMMUNE Core — Stability Regulation

Prevents:
- Overreaction to noise
- Oscillation under uncertainty
- Instability from signal degradation

---

### 3.5 EPR — Regenerative Recovery

Enables:
- Local rollback
- State reconstruction
- Damage containment
- Controlled re-specialization

Prevents cascading collapse.

---

### 3.6 TUNSYNC — Partition Tolerance

Maintains:
- Offline execution continuity
- Signed knowledge packet exchange
- Conflict-safe merge logic

Ensures survivability under network fragmentation.

---

### 3.7 RIL — Integrity-Bound Reinforcement

Prevents:
- Self-corruption in learning loops
- Contaminated feedback amplification
- Unbounded update propagation

Reinforcement is trust-gated.

---

### 3.8 ZEP — Epistemic Abstention Protocol

Permits:
- Safe non-action
- Confidence collapse detection
- Explicit unknown state declaration

Abstention is preserved as a valid output.

---

### 3.9 PAL — Power Abstraction Layer

Enables:
- Energy-aware scaling
- Thermal-aware execution
- Deterministic low-power mode
- Compute scheduling under surplus

Cognition adapts to energy availability.

## 4. Runtime Behavior Model

When integrated, the Reactor Mesh enforces:

1. Execution is conditional.
2. Outputs are evidence-weighted.
3. Behavioral drift is immune-monitored.
4. Noise does not trigger instability.
5. Local damage does not require global restart.
6. Partition does not collapse operation.
7. Reinforcement cannot corrupt core state.
8. Abstention remains preserved.

This produces deterministic degradation instead of catastrophic failure.

---

## 5. Failure Containment Matrix

| Failure Class | Containment Mechanism |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Unbounded execution | SPARC |
| Hallucinated truth | ARC |
| Behavioral drift | IMMU |
| Instability | IMMUNE |
| Permanent damage | EPR |
| Partition collapse | TUNSYNC |
| Reinforcement corruption | RIL |
| Overconfidence | ZEP |

Reliability emerges from layered constraint enforcement.

---

## 6. Operational Outcome

The Reactor Mesh produces:

- Stable cognition under degraded environments
- Reduced hallucination propagation
- Partition-tolerant operation
- Self-stabilizing intelligence
- Regenerative continuity
- Trust-preserving abstention

It behaves as a low-entropy distributed intelligence reactor.

---

## 7. Limitations

- Conceptual architecture (no reference implementation)
- Requires formal modeling for validation
- Requires simulation for empirical evaluation
- Dependent on constraint enforcement fidelity

This module defines structural requirements, not deployment guidance.
