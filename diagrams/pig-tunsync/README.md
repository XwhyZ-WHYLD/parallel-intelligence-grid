# PIG-TUNSYNC — Integrity-First Dormancy Protocol

## Hypothesis

When knowledge or connectivity collapses, intelligence must **contract**, not improvise.

Dormancy is a feature, not a failure.

---

## What This Module Is

PIG-TUNSYNC governs **bounded cognition and cryptobiotic dormancy**
for offline, partitioned, or epistemically unstable environments.

---

## Core States

- Active Mode — full cognition
- Degraded Mode — constrained reasoning
- Tun State — cryptobiotic dormancy
- Controlled Resync — ordered reactivation

---

## Tun State Guarantees

- Policies remain immutable
- No generative fabrication
- Evidence preserved
- Drift prevented
- Resume only when coherent

---

## Exit Conditions

- Network reconnection
- Epistemic threshold met
- Ledger convergence verified

---

## Failure Mode Prevented

Most distributed systems fail during **recovery**, not outage.
TUNSYNC enforces safe resume.

---

## Summary

PIG-TUNSYNC ensures intelligence **knows when to shut up — and how to come back alive**.
