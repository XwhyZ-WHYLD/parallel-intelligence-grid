# Epimorphic Prompt Regeneration (EPR)

## What This Module Is

EPR is the **cognitive regeneration engine** of PIG.
It enables role reset, local healing, and re-specialization under damage.

---

## Regeneration Phases

1. Drift detection
2. Dedifferentiation (role reset)
3. Blastema cluster formation
4. Prompt DNA exchange
5. Redifferentiation

---

## Constraints

- Local only
- Time-boxed
- Budgeted
- No global authority

---

## What EPR Prevents

- Cascading hallucinations
- Stale specialization
- Role lock-in
- Full system restart

---

## Summary

EPR allows intelligence to **forget safely, relearn locally, and resume without collapse**.
