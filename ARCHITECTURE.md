# Parallel Intelligence Grid — Canonical Architecture

## 1. Design Assumptions
- Failure is the norm
- Connectivity is partial
- Intelligence must abstain safely

## 2. Core Layers
- PIG Core
- RIL (Regenerative Intelligence Layer)
- PIG-IMMUNE
- PIG-TUNSYNC

## 3. Governance Separation
- Global Orchestrator (no validation, no healing)
- SPARC (execution governance)
- EPR (cognitive regeneration)

## 4. System Invariants
(links to invariants/*.md)

## 5. Failure & Recovery Paths
(links to threat-models/*.md)

## 6. What This Is Not
- Not AGI
- Not autonomous agents
- Not a product

### Adaptive Resilience & Compensation (ARC)

ARC is the truth-integrity and degradation control layer of PIG.
It ensures that weak, noisy, or partial signal does not result in hallucination,
unsafe amplification, or confidence inflation.

ARC enforces evidence-bound output, deterministic degradation behavior,
and abstention when signal quality falls below enforceable thresholds.
