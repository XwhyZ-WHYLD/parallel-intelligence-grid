Architecture for resilient, governed, and regenerative intelligence under uncertainty.

# Parallel Intelligence Grid (PIG)

**Architecture for intelligence that survives reality.**

Parallel Intelligence Grid (PIG) is a distributed intelligence architecture designed to operate under uncertainty, partial connectivity, and failure. Instead of optimizing for continuous availability or maximal capability, PIG prioritizes governed execution, immune-grade survivability, deterministic regeneration, and integrity-preserving dormancy.

PIG assumes failure is the norm, not the exception.

## What This Repository Is

This repository documents the **architecture, design doctrine, and failure models** behind PIG, including:

- Governed intelligence execution
- Evidence-bound outputs and abstention
- Regenerative Intelligence Layer (RIL)
- Immune-grade governance (PIG-IMMUNE)
- Epimorphic Prompt Regeneration (EPR)
- Integrity-first dormancy and resynchronization (PIG-TUNSYNC)

This is a **research and architecture repository**, not a product, SDK, or implementation.

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not a model
- Not an AGI claim
- Not a framework or library
- Not a startup pitch
- Not a benchmark demo

---

## Core Design Principles

- **Integrity > Availability**
- **Abstention > Hallucination**
- **Regeneration > Restart**
- **Bounded adaptation > irreversible learning**
- **Survivability > optimization**

---

## Intended Audience

- AI systems architects
- Government and defense technologists
- Infrastructure and resilience researchers
- Long-horizon investors and patrons
- AI governance and safety leaders

---

## Affiliation

Developed under **WHYLD**, a future systems research initiative of **XWHYz** (UAE).

---

## Status

This repository is under active architectural refinement.  
Code may follow later; architecture comes first.
